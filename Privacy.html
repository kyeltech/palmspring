                                                 We collect and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, our

                                                (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer
                                                the Websites. We may track your movement within the Websites, the third-party website pages from which you were

                                                and to provide you with information we believe might be of interest to you. In addition, such information may be shared
                                                with affiliates, partners, market researchers and other unaffiliated third parties on an aggregate, non-personally
                                                identifiable basis. No personally identifiable information will be linked to such aggregated information that is shared
                                                with third parties, other than those third parties with whom we partner or with whom we have solicitation, licensing or
                                                similar arrangements. We may supplement the information you provide us by acquiring publicly or commercially available
                                                information as is available in the public domain or from third parties, such as our affiliates, data brokers, business
                                                partners, payment and delivery services, and advertising networks, for instance, to verify your address, add a telephone
                                                number, or to update your information and to create a profile of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable
                                                information to information in the profile, in order to improve the content of the Websites for you or to inform you
                                                about Services or other products that we think may be of interest to you. From time to time, we may also ask you to
